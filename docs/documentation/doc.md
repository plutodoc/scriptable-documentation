## JavaScript Environment

Scriptable uses Apple's [JavaScriptCore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore), which supports [ECMAScript 6](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp).

## Learning JavaScript

If you're just getting started with JavaScript, you may want to take a look at Codecademys [Intro to Programming in JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/programming-with-javascript). For a quick reference to JavaScripts features, you may refer to W3Schools' [JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp).

Note that some guides and tutorials will assume that you're running JavaScript in a browser and therefore have access to browser specific objects, such as a document. Scriptable does not run JavaScript in a browser and therefore such objects do not exist.
